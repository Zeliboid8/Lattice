# Lattice
Scheduling and event planning app

Lattice is a scheduling app that helps you coordinate event planning with others. 
Setting up a schedule is as easy as importing a calendar from Google Calendar or iCal or blocking the times you're available in the calendar blocking tool. After you've created a schedule, you can create groups with friends, family, or coworkers to instantly find overlapping times and highlight availability. You can view group calendars and look at dates and times that work best for everyone all through a simple and intuitive interface.

When making an event, you can choose how much you care about showing to the rest of the world: private events only show that you're busy during a given time, whereas public events show your friends what you're doing. This gives you total control over how much you want to show to your groups. Whether it's choosing the best times for office hours, setting up weekly meetings, or figuring out when to have a weekend getaway, Lattice is perfect for any scheduling, regardless of how formal or personal your plans are.
